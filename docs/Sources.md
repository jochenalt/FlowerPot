## FAQ

### 3D print
I used the Zortrax M200 printer with Z-ultrat, a high-temperature ABS. For all parts besides plugs and belt spanners and gears I applied the  parameters 0,14mm resolution, 4 layers wall thickness and 15% infill. For the latter, I used 50% infill. All in all, Walter required ca. 2kg filament.
