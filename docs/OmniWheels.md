# Omniwheels - Make or Buy

What a stupid question. The omniwheel I was looking for should follow the idea of the [japanese patent 2001-191704](https://astamuse.com/ja/published/JP/No/2001191704) from 2001.

The [CAD model](https://github.com/jochenalt/Ondine/blob/master/CAD/OmniWheel.iam) has been designed to be 3D printed, which means that the space between the rolls and the spoke holding the wheels should be really tight in order to gain stability of the spoke. Omniwheels of this type that are made of steel can have a much simpler spoke, but having in mind that the full load is carried by typically one spoke with only some mm thickness requires carefull use of space available. This leads to a spoke with a constant distance to the rolls. When designing this, I tried less rolls, different angles of a big and a small roll, and various radius of the rolls. But finally I arrived at dimensions that are very similar to the underlaying patent.

As a courtesy to the japanese patent, the 3D-printed parts are arranged in beautiful manner:

The first assembly looked like this

Then, I realized, that the friction of ABS on a ball made of rubber or something was quite poor. There's little you can do about the 3d printed material, so I needed some kind of cover, and ended up with corundum of grain size 0.1-0.2mm. Corundum has sharp edges (compared with plain sand), and gives quite a good friction with rubber. Luckily, this material is used for blasting and easily available. That only thing is, that you need to order 5kg at least. The 4,9kg left can be put in the garden to attract and fool ants.

To glue corundum to the rolls I used 2-component epoxy glue, which is quite messy.
