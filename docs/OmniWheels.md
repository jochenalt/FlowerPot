# Omniwheels

The omniwheel I was looking for should follow the idea of the [japanese patent 2001-191704](https://astamuse.com/ja/published/JP/No/2001191704) from 2001.

The original patent has a surprising design of the big roll. Its width is much smaller than the small rolls, and it runs one one bearing only. Due to my poor japanese I was not able to find out why the authors chose a design so complex to manufacture. My [CAD model](https://github.com/jochenalt/Ondine/blob/master/CAD/OmniWheel.iam) needs to be 3d-printed, and the spoke of the patent is so thin, that this would never work. The spoke needs to carry the full weight, so it requires much more material on the spots where the bearings are held. In order to allow more material  in the little space available, I designed the spoke with a constant distant to the roll.

I ended up with that design, that has an identical width of all rolls and two bearings each.

As a courtesy to the japanese patent, the 3D-printed parts are arranged in beautiful manner:

The first assembly looked like this

Then I realized, that the friction of ABS rolls on a ball made of rubber or something was quite poor. There's little you can do about the 3d printed material, so I needed some kind of cover. I was thinking of rubber spray, but found out, that sand paper has a perfect friction on rubber. So, I looked for a material similar to sand paper and found corundum, which is sand with sharp edges. Originally it is used for blasting, so it is quite cheap to get. Thing is, that you can it order in quantities of at least 5kg only. The remaining 4,95kg can be put in the garden to attract and fool ants.

To glue corundum to the rolls I used 2-component epoxy glue. It is a messy experience to coat small rolls with glue and rolling them in a can of corundum sand.
