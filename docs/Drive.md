# Drive Chain

Driving Omniwheels requires precise control, particularly when the bot is not moving. During balancing all motors move around the same position with many changes in directon. A regular drive with a geared brushed motor has a certain amount of backlash. Small corrections of the bot's position won't have an impact until the motor overcomes the backlash. Therefore, the controller will always overshoot allowing a smaller gain only. Therefore, it is essential to have a small backlash in the motor/drive combination.

# Torque, Power, and Gearbox Ratio 
I estimated the bot's weight approx. 3kg (=29N). A maximum tilt angle around 15° gives a force of 7N to be delivered by the drive. Ignoring the fact that a wheel's axis is not always perpendicular to the direction, and having wheels with a radius of 35mm results in a torque provided by one wheel of 7N*35mm = 0.025Nm. Motors typically provide 3000 RPM, the Bot's to-be speed should be 1m/s, so a wheel has a maximum speed of 2.4 rev/s. This gives a gearbox ratio of 1:20 max. I choose a gearbox ratio of 1:9. So, the motors torque should be 0.002Nm at 1500 RPM.
When I started looking for motors, I was lucky and made a snip on ebay, so all the computations above were useless. Anyhow, I got these wonderfull brushless [40W Maxon motors](https://www.maxonmotor.com/maxon/view/product/272768) for 5€ each

# Failed Gearboxes
The quality of these motors were setting the scene, the gearbox had to be close to this. A gearbox from maxon was no option (starts at 150€), and I had the ambition to build something without backlash. So, I tried a [harmonic drive with timing belts](https://hackaday.io/project/19405-strain-wave-gear-with-timing-belts) based on Simon Merrets ideas, and I had a go with a cycloid drive due to its mechanical beauty. Both suffered from the same deficiency: The parts were 3D-printed with a precision of 0.2mm at best, which is not sufficient to get a proper efficiency. Boths gears were groaning loudly and had a significant inner friction. The motor had to supply a significant amount of power to overcome this friction and started moving with a small jerk.

Next try was a planetary box which turned out to be acceptable. Play was low, required space was ok as well:

But, after reducing the distance between the gears to minimize the play, the gearbox started to produce an annoying plastic sound even after adding a heringbone gearing, so I dismissed this as well.

# Final Gearbox 
Last and successful try was the most boring gear type: timing belts. Still, the advantages were convincing: Low play by nature, silent, and cheap. Only issue is the space required. But this could be mitigated by a design which outer dimensions is dominated by the wheels only not wasting too much space with hubs or flanges etc:

In total the belt drive is embedded into the enclosure like this

Especially the bearing of the output axis inside the pinion at the motor made this thing compact:

In the first try the timing belts touched the verge of the pinions resulting in an awful squeaking, until I gave the pinion's teeth a round profile that centred the timing belt in the middle of the teeth.  In order to not have remains of suport material coming from the 3D printing process, I cut the pinion's CAD model by half, and glued it after printing. It can be  seen on the original parts (the fine line in the middle of the pinion)

The big wheel has bushings on both sides of the axis

<img  height="200px" src="../images/beltdrive/IMG_20181013_113650.jpg" >

The output wheel incorporates a mounting hub to connect the wheel and the axis

Assembly starts with the enclosure and the output wheel. The three threaded rods that look out of the enclosure are hex head screws I glued into the enclosure to prevent them falling into the enclosure.

Then the big wheel and the output timing belt is added (the stains on top of the enclosure is my blood)

<img  height="300px" src="../images/beltdrive/IMG_20181013_114005.jpg" >

The pinion and the motor is assembled like this. 

<img  height="300px" src="../images/beltdrive/IMG_20180922_100241.jpg" >

And in a tricky operation the motor is moved into the enclosure, keeping the second timing belt at the right position

Finally it looks like this (without encoder)

<img  height="300px" src="../images/beltdrive/IMG_20180922_100613.jpg" >

Now, the motor needs to be pushed into the enclosure until the output axis has no axial play anymore. Then, the motor can be screwed in its enclosure.

<img  height="300px" src="../images/beltdrive/IMG_20181013_115437.jpg" >

This is done three times. Then, the drive chains are screwd to the bottom part of the bot

and it is really moving!
