# Electronics

Electronics takes care of the following topics

* <b>Control of the three brushless motors</b>. Brushless motoros require more control and electronics than brushed motors. Since industrial controlers are quite expensive, I did my own.  
* <b>running Kinematics and state control</b>. Kinematics and state control need to run with a high frequency and reasonable precision. 
* <b>communicate with the outside world</b>. The bot communicates with the outside world via a small webserver connected to a local Wifi.
